<h1>
    Week 1
</h1>

<body>
First, I want to thank <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr8biZfSZ3Y&t=477s">Carter Semrad</a> for this idea<br>
This is going to be my first installation of weekly projects that I code. <br>
It is to see any progress of my coding skills/things that I learn and to have a collection of it.<br>
<h2>
    Plan:<br> 
</h2>
To create a website where I could track projects in HTML and create a template for future updating.<br>

<h2>
    Skills:<br>
</h2>
    <a href="..\..\Skills\html.html">HTML</a> |
    <a href="..\..\Skills\css.html">CSS</a> |
    <a href="..\..\Skills\javascript.html">JavaScript</a> <br> 
<h2>
    Process:<br>
</h2>

This is a rather straightforward project, but one that needed to be done. <br>
I started by creating the default <a href="..\..\..\ProjectAWeek\index.html">index.html</a> and the app.css and app.js<br>
This index.html links to all of the other weeks. I'll have to update weekly to the website <br>
But there isn't a good way around it. I made a <a href="..\weekTemplate.html">template</a> to make each addition easier.
Additionally, I had to connect this to git to utilize the free website hosting of GitHub



<h2>
    Cool Things learned:<br>
</h2>
(I know these are really small and easy, but I want to get into the habit)<br>
Here are some useful tricks and html shenanigans I used:<br><br>

Creating hyperlinks:
<code>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"&gt; Click on this Link! &lt;/a&gt; </code><br><br>
Navigation:
<code>location.replace("\..\..\ProjectAWeek\index.html")</code><br><br>
New tab:
<code>window.open("\..\..\ProjectAWeek\index.html")</code><br><br>
Pushing with git:<br>
<code>Navigate to the project in terminal</code><br>
<code>git status</code><br>
<code>git commit -m "Set up git"</code><br>
<code>git push origin master</code><br>

</body>

<button onClick = "goBack()">
Go back!
